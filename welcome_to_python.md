## What is Python? ##
* Python is nothing but a software written in `C` using which you can write programs very easily
* You can get the source code of python from [here](https://github.com/python/cpython)
* Normally when people say python that means `Cpython`
* There are different implementations of python like `Jython`, `Ipython` etc. So dont get confused, our guy is `Cpython`

## Who is the creator? Who maintains it? ##
* [Guido van Rossum](https://github.com/gvanrossum) is the guy who originally wrote python
* Now its supported and maintained by [the PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/) and the python community (When I say community the guys who are interested in python and who thrives to make it better)

## Which OS do I need linux? Mac? Windows? ##
* You can run it anywhere, any OS is fine

## How can I start writing python programs? ##
* If you are in windows, download and install python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - If you are not sure which version to use, I prefer you start with 2.7.x version
* It comes by default in Mac and Linux operating systems, you can kick it off by just typing `python` in the terminal
