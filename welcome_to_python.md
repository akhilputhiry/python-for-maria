## What is Python? ##
* Python is nothing but a software written in `C` using which you can write programs very easily
* You can get the source code of python from [here](https://github.com/python/cpython)
* Normally when people say python that means `Cpython`
* There are different implementations of python like `Jython`, `Ipython` etc. So dont get confused, our guy is `Cpython`

## Who is the creator? Who maintains it? ##
* [Guido van Rossum](https://github.com/gvanrossum) is the guy who originally wrote python
* Now its supported and maintained by [the PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/) and the python community (When I say community the guys who are interested in python and who thrives to make it better)
